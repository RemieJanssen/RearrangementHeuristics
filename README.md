# RearrangementHeuristics
Heuristic algorithms for finding rearrangement move sequences between phylogenetic networks.
These are all based on the algorithms in Remie Janssen's PhD thesis, where they are tested as well.

To use the software, run the main python file in the terminal.
For help, run: python RearrDistance_Main.py -h
